Constituents:
===============
pom.xml  - Aggregator POM
acl - ACL Implementation
docs - Docbook module 
identity - Identity API implementation 
jbosssx  - Default implementation of the JBoss Security SPI 
jbosssx-client  - Submodule that jars up a client jar 

To Build the Overall Artifact:
=============================
trunk>  mvn install 
Note that the mvn install command will scroll pages on your terminal. Hence it is better to do
mvn install 2>&1 >somefile

Then you open the "somefile" to see how the tests have fared

To Build the artifacts for individual projects:
==============================================
Do "mvn install"

Deploy The Artifacts:
====================
mvn deploy

Remember: You will need to set up the settings.xml in your maven directory for the artifacts to be transferred to JBAS svn repository.
